# Metrics

We provide various metrics about memory, disk, and important procedures. These metrics could help identify performance
issue or monitor RSS cluster.

## Prerequisites

1.Enable RSS metrics.
set rss.metrics.system.enabled = true  
2.You need to install prometheus(https://prometheus.io/)  
We provide an example for prometheus config file

```yaml
# prometheus example config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "RSS"
    metrics_path: /metrics/prometheus
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: [ "emr-header-1:9098","emr-worker-1:9096","emr-worker-2:9096","emr-worker-3:9096","emr-worker-4:9096" ]
```

3.You need to install Grafana server(https://grafana.com/)

| CommitFilesTime      | worker      | CommitFiles means flush and close a shuffle partition file.      |
| ReserveSlotsTime      | worker      | ReserveSlots means acquire a disk buffer and record partition location.      |
| FlushDataTime      | worker      | FlushData means flush a disk buffer to disk.      |
| OpenStreamTime      | worker      | OpenStream means read a shuffle file and send client about chunks size and stream index.      |
| FetchChunkTime      | worker      | FetchChunk means read a chunk from a shuffle file and send to client.      |
| MasterPushDataTime      | worker      | MasterPushData means handle pushdata of master partition location.      |
| SlavePushDataTime      | worker      | MasterPushData means handle pushdata of slave partition location.      |
| PushDataFailCount      | worker      | The count of failed PushData or PushMergedData.      |
| TakeBufferTime      | worker      | TakeBuffer means get a disk buffer from disk flusher.      |
| TotalSlots      | worker      | TotalSlots means the slots of a worker.      |
| SlotsUsed      | worker      |       |
| SlotsAvailable      | worker      |       |
| NettyMemory      | worker      | The value measures all kinds of transport memory used by netty.      |
| SortTime      | worker      | SortTime measures the time used by sorting a shuffle file.      |
| SortMemory      | worker      | SortMemory means total reserved memory for sorting shuffle files .      |
| SortingFiles      | worker      | This value means the count of sorting shuffle files.      |
| DiskBuffer      | worker      | Disk buffers are part of netty used memory, means data need to write to disk but haven't been written to disk.      |
| PausePushData      | worker      | PausePushData means the count of worker stopped receiving data from client.      |
| PausePushDataAndReplicate      | worker      | PausePushDataAndReplicate means the count of worker stopped receiving data from client and other workers.      |

## Implementation

RSS master metric : `com/aliyun/emr/rss/service/deploy/master/MasterSource.scala`  
RSS worker metric : `com/aliyun/emr/rss/service/deploy/master/MasterSource.scala`  
and `com.aliyun.rss.common.metrics.source.NetWorkSource`  

## Grafana Dashboard

We provide a grafana dashboard for RSS [Grafana-Dashboard](assets/grafana/rss-dashboard.json). The dashboard was generated by grafana which version is 8.5.0.
